# C++

C ++ is a middle-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 at Bell Labs.


C Runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX.


## Application of C++ Programming: -

-  **Application Software Development: -** C++ Programming has been used in developing almost all the major Operating systems linke WIndows, MacOSX and LInux. Apart from the operating systems, the core part of many browsers like Mozilla Firefox and chrome have been written using C++.
C++ also has been used in developing the most popular database system called MySQL.

- **Programming Languages Development: -** C++ has been used extensively in developing new programming languages like C#, Java, Javascript, Perl, UNIX's C Shell, PHP and Python, and Verilog etc.

- **Computation Programming: -** C++ is the best friends of scientists because of fast speed and computational efficiencies.

- **Games Development: -** C++ is extremel fast which allows programmers to do procedural programming for CPU intensive functions and provides greater control over hardware, because of which it has been widely used in development of gaming engines.

- **Embedded Systems: -** C++ is being heavily used in developing Medical and Engineering Applications like softwares for MRI machines, high-end CAD/CAM systems etc.

--------------

C++ is a statically typed, compiled, general-purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming.

C++ is regarded as a middle-level langauage, as it comprises a combination of both high-level and low-level language features.


C++ is a superset of C, and that virtually and leagal C program is a legal C++ program.

## Object-Oriented Programming: -

**C++ fully support object-oriented programming, including the four pillars of object-oriented development: -**

- **Encapsulation**
- **Data hiding**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**
