# Inheritance

In C++, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories: -

- **derived class**(child) - The class that inherits from another class.

- **base class**(parent) - The class being inherited from.

**To inherit from a class, we use ":" symbol**
